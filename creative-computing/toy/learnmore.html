		<p> MASH is a two-player paper-and-pencil game, commonly played by children intended to predict one's future. The name is an acronym of "Mansion, Apartment, Shack/Street/Shed/Sewers/Swamp, and House". In this version, the game has been expanded to "MASHCOW" for "Cottage, Outhouse, Whitehouse." Alternatively, the game can be expanded to "DMASH" (the D standing for Dome) or "MASHO" (O standing for outhouse) or "MASH-IT" (the I standing for igloo and the T for tent) or "SMASH" (the S standing for School bus). </p>
